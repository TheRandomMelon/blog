<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  Sorry that I haven't been using this blog. I promise, I'll show more exciting stuff in the future!
</div>

With that disclaimer over, let's get rollin'.

# Homepage
The homepage has been **drastically** improved. Here's a pic:

<img src="/img/posts/bothered-to-update/newsite.png" class="border post-image border-success rounded-top">
<span class="image-desc border-top-0 rounded-bottom border-success">The new homepage.</span>

I felt like the old cards with the image on top were very cluttered. Now, we can show the latest 5 posts with the smaller, condensed cards. ~~That's when I do somehow make more than 5 posts but~~

# Posts/About me page
You've probably noticed the nice new Jumbotron instead of a card. It looks pretty nice doesn't it? Plus, I've added these helpers: ``.text-drop-shadow-light``, ``text-drop-shadow-dark``, ``box-drop-shadow-dark``, and ``box-drop-shadow-light``.

These are helpful helpers that you can see in action right on this page. Here's a screenshot of a post. Let's have a more mobile view, why not.

<img src="/img/posts/bothered-to-update/mobile-blog-post.png" class="border post-image border-success rounded-top">
<span class="image-desc border-top-0 rounded-bottom border-success">A post on mobile devices.</span>

# New font
The font is now the native font stack (which means the font will be your system font) instead of Lato.

Try it out for yourself! Check on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or whatever other OS you can think of.

# That's it.
