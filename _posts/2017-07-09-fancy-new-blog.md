Hi,


I've finally made a blog, powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages!

# F.A.Q before they're frequently asked

### Do you have an RSS feed for the blog
Yup! [Right here.](/feed.xml) Subscribe today, if people still use RSS feeds...

### I want to comment! Where's the comments section?
That's coming soon. For now, send me a tweet ([@michaelwebbtrm](https://twitter.com/michaelwebbtrm)), or DM me on Discord to tell me your thoughts!

Alright, that's all I have for now! Subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml), and [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelwebbtrm) if you want.
