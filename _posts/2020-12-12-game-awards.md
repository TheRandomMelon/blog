# What is the TRM Community Game Awards?
In short: The TRM Community Game Awards came from a determination by the community to have a Google Form-based poll decide these categories rather than the official Game Awards' certified gaming "journalists". This is the results of that poll.

# Game of the Year

<span class="image-desc border-top-0 rounded-bottom border-success">The Game of the Year is DOOM Eternal. Right click -> View image in new tab for full screen viewing.</span>

I'm honestly not too surprised by this result. In my opinion, DOOM Eternal is an awesome game and deserves this nomination. It was pretty close, though, as you can see above.
# Best Sound Design

<span class="image-desc border-top-0 rounded-bottom border-success">The game with the best sound design is DOOM Eternal. Right click -> View image in new tab for full screen viewing.</span>

This is also not **too** much of a shocker, but I still think all of those could've won this category. DOOM Eternal's soundtrack is an absolute banger, I'll say that much.
# Best RPG

<span class="image-desc border-top-0 rounded-bottom border-success">The game with the best sound design is Paper Mario: The Origami King. Right click -> View image in new tab for full screen viewing.</span>

Now **THIS** was a result that truly shocked me. I wasn't expecting Paper Mario: The Origami King to win this category. Yes, it's a pretty good game, but I was actually expecting Persona 5 Royal to win, considering that (in my view) it was really the biggest RPG release of 2020. I guess you have to expect the unexpected, huh?

# Best Ongoing Game

<span class="image-desc border-top-0 rounded-bottom border-success">The Best Ongoing Game is Minecraft (2009). Right click -> View image in new tab for full screen viewing.</span>

A "ongoing game" is a game that has released at *least*  2+ years ago, and has been recieving continous updates, patches and new features to flesh out the game further since then. I'm not surprised Minecraft won this one, honestly. It really does deserve this title, considering the fact that it's still a pretty relevant game today, and has been recieving constant updates and new features since its initial release. It's definitely a true testament to Minecraft's legacy in gaming history as a whole.

# The Other Categories
These are all of the ones that I'll show, but have no commentary on. I hope you guys enjoyed seeing these results and participating! Thank you to all of the 19 respondants to the poll. You guys are, of course, what made these results possible. Let's hope for more responses next year, eh? 

And, of course, a special thank you for a great 2020 for my YouTube channel and especially my Twitch channel! Cheers to 2021 hopefully not being 2020 Part II.
